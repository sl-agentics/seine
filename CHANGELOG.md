# Changelog

A rules engine whose pitch is auditability keeps an auditable release
history. Entries start at the why-machine arc; earlier releases are
recorded in DECISIONS.md.

## Unreleased

- **Decimal ingestion is verbatim** (measured against the oracle): a
  string keeps its own scale — `"1.1"` stays `1.1`, and `"1.005"`
  into a `decimal(10,2)` field is no longer silently rounded to
  `1.01`; integers ingest at scale 0. The declared `(p,s)` remains
  the Arrow column contract (and precision is still enforced) —
  it no longer rewrites working-memory values.
- **Truth-maintenance identity is scale-sensitive** (like
  `BigDecimal.equals`): logically inserting `2.50` and `2.500`
  yields two distinct justified facts, exactly as the oracle's
  generated equality does.
- **Numeric literals cannot construct or set decimal fields** in
  DRL (`insert(new Bal(2.5))`, `setV(2.5)`) — now a build error
  matching the oracle's, with steering to bindings and ingested
  data. Comparisons and in-lists over decimal fields are unchanged.

## 0.4.41

- **Exact decimal average** — `average_exact(field, scale=…,
  rounding="half_up")`: sum and count accumulate exactly, one
  division at the chosen scale with java.math rounding semantics
  (`BigDecimal.divide(count, scale, mode)` — certified
  value-for-value against oracle programs computing exactly that,
  across all seven RoundingModes and both signs). `scale` defaults
  to the source field's scale; modes: up, down, ceiling, floor,
  half_up (default), half_down, half_even. Decimal sources only —
  `average` stays IEEE double. Nulls skip both sum and count; an
  empty or all-null source doesn't fire (like `average`).

## 0.4.40

- **Decimal sum identity matches BigDecimal exactly** (found by the
  new decimal fuzz axis): a sum over an empty or all-null decimal
  source is now `Decimal("0")` — `BigDecimal.ZERO`, scale 0 — not
  `0.00` at the field's scale; a sum drained back to zero keeps its
  contribution scale (`0.00`), exactly like BigDecimal subtraction.
  Runtime decimal values also keep their own scale when stored into
  fields (declared precision still enforced); only string/int
  ingestion normalizes to the declared scale. Numeric comparisons
  are unaffected (compareTo semantics); only rendered scale moves.
- **Self-maintaining logical aggregates** — `insertLogical` from
  accumulate, groupby, and collect rules is in-subset (previously a
  build error): re-accumulation retracts the superseded logical
  result and derives the new one, downstream logical facts retract
  through the swap, groups maintain independently, and same-value
  recomputation dedups. Certified engine-vs-oracle (measured against
  Drools' own maintenance), exact over decimal sums, and expressible
  from the rule builder (`then_insert_logical(Bal, v=total)`) — the
  derived balance and everything under it stays `why()`-auditable.
  `?query` and windowed-accumulate justifiers remain build errors.
- **The reversible balance-gate idiom is documented and pinned**: a
  sum inserted as a new fact per recomputation leaves superseded
  results in memory, so logical facts derived from the old value
  survive their own reversal (Drools behaves identically — measured).
  The safe idiom — one result row updated in place behind a
  not-equal guard — is documented on `sum_`, certified
  engine-vs-oracle, and covered end-to-end from the rule builder.
- Accumulate-result match elements over decimal now render as
  `BigDecimal` (the oracle's Java simple name), like the other boxed
  scalars.

## 0.4.39

- **Decimal overflow is a typed, catchable error** — inline multiply
  and accumulate-sum overflow past `DECIMAL(38)` now raise a plain
  engine error (`except Exception` catches it; no Rust backtrace, no
  `PanicException`), and the session stays usable afterwards. Both
  previously surfaced as panics at eval time.

## 0.4.38

- **Inline decimal arithmetic in rule constraints** — the certified
  agree subset: `principal + fee >= limit` over `decimal(p,s)` fields
  computes exactly (i128, java.math scale rules) with
  compareTo-exact comparisons against decimal fields and int
  literals. Measured against Drools' BigDecimal/MVEL semantics
  (33-cell pin campaign) and certified cell-for-cell.
- **The poison is fenced, loudly**: decimal `/` and `%` (the oracle
  silently degrades them to IEEE double), doubles anywhere in
  decimal arithmetic, and double-literal comparands (the oracle
  coerces literals raw-binary — `== 3.30` can never fire on an
  exactly-3.30 result there; boundaries poison asymmetrically).
  Every fence names its reason and steers to the exact idiom.
- RHS decimal arithmetic remains a build error — now certified as
  error parity: the oracle rejects it too.

## 0.4.37

- **Wheel coverage**: Linux wheels now build in `manylinux_2_28`
  containers (RHEL 8 / UBI8, Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 11 get wheels
  instead of silent sdist builds), and the matrix adds
  `linux-aarch64` (Graviton / Axion / arm64 Docker) and
  `musllinux_1_2` x86_64 + aarch64 (Alpine images). macOS
  (arm64 + x86_64) and Windows unchanged.
- **Nullable aggregation** reaches the Python rule builder:
  `sum_`/`min_`/`max_`/`average` accept nullable numeric and decimal
  fields (null contributions are skipped, per the certified
  null-skipping semantics). Aggregate results type non-nullable.
- `sum_` documents the empty/all-null identity-0 footgun and the
  existence-guard idiom.

## 0.4.36

- **`Session.acc_sources(handle)`** — aggregation provenance: for an
  accumulate/groupby result fact (its handle is in the firing's match
  tuple, visible via `fire(on_fire=...)`), returns the
  `(source_handle, contribution)` pairs that produced the result's
  current value, snapshotted at computation. Null-skipped matches
  appear as `(handle, None)`. Closes the audit walk end-to-end:
  `why()` through the logical layer, `acc_sources()` through the
  summation to the line-item leaves.

## 0.4.35

- **`Session.why(handle)` / `Session.justifications()`** — the
  justification graph in Python: per derived (`insertLogical`) fact,
  its supports (justifying rule, matched tuple handles, firing seq)
  and live stated siblings; `None` for stated/dead/unknown handles.
  The support list is the retraction contract.
- **Decimal aggregation in the rule builder**: `sum_` over
  `decimal(p,s)` fields computes exactly (result widens to
  `decimal(38,s)`); `min_`/`max_` preserve the type; `average` is
  f64 by design (exact decimal division requires an explicit
  rounding mode).

## 0.4.34

- **Derive-plane regex**: `col().regexp_matches(pat)` (search) and
  `col().regexp_full_match(pat)`, dialect-pinned against DuckDB/RE2;
  patterns are build-time literals with loud invalid-pattern errors.
- Query-machine performance: the batch-prepend quadratic is gone
  (large `?query` pulls are ~linear).

## 0.4.33

- Deep logical-derivation chains run in ~linear time (the teardown
  and staging quadratics are gone); cyclic computed `insertLogical`
  (fixpoints, transitive closure) is in-subset.
- LHS whole-slot arithmetic and computed RHS args are expressible
  from the Python rule builder.
